# Getting Started

To get started with the Messaging Hub, this tutorial will show you how to create and register a custom application in the Messaging Hub and publish it in the [Omni](http://www.omnisms.com.br/webtools/) application.

## Creating your application

The templates for a getting started application can be downloaded from [our SDK page](../sdks).

They are already configured to connect to the Messaging Hub when the application starts, but before, you need to register it.

## Registering your application

You need to register the application in the [Messaging Hub Console](http://messaginghub.io/console).
To do so, follow these steps:

- Access [http://messaginghub.io/console](http://messaginghub.io/console) and create your profile.
- Go to [http://messaginghub.io/application/add](http://messaginghub.io/application/add) to register the application.
- Inform a name, select an image and inform a text that describes it. 

## Publishing your application

Still in the [Messaging Hub Console](http://messaginghub.io/console), you need to publish your application in the Omni domain to make it available as a service in the Omni services catalog.
To do so, follow these steps:

- In the [http://messaginghub.io/application/list](http://messaginghub.io/application/list), find your application and click the `Details` button.
- Click the `Domains` tab, find the `Omni` domain and click `Activate`.
- Click `Activate` again and you are done. In a few moments your application will be registered in the Omni services catalog.

## Running your application

After creating and registering your application, start it and leave it running. 

## Using the application

[Install the Omni](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.take.omni) app, if you havenÂ´t already, and run it.

Find your application in the services catalog and start a new thread.

Send a message and see your application react the way you've programmed (by default, it will simply respond with `"It works!"`).
