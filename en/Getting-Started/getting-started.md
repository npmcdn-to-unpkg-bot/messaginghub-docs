# Getting Started

To get started with the Messaging Hub, this tutorial will show you how to create a `Talk to OMNI` feature.

In this use case, you can register your organization as a [Smart Contact](./smart-contact.md) to be reached through the [OMNI](http://www.omnisms.com.br/webtools/) application.

Step 1: Register your `Smart Contact` in the `Messaging Hub`:
- Access `http://console.messaginghub.io` and register your profile.
- Go to `http://console.messaginghub.io/application/add` to register your `Smart Contact`.
- Inform a name for your `Smart Contact`, like the name of your organization. Select an image and inform a text that describes it. 

Step 2: Publish tour `Smart Contact` to the `OMNI` catalog:
- In the `http://console.messaginghub.io/application/list`, find your `Smart Contact` and click the Details button.
- Click the `Domains` tab, find the `OMNI` domain and click `Activate`.
- Click on `Activate` and you are done. Now your application is already registered in the `OMNI` catalog.

Step 3: Spread the Word
- Inform your customers that they now can [download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.take.omni) the `OMNI` app, find your `Smart Contact` in the services catalog and send messages to your organization.
